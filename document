 i opened the folder 
 opened the terminal and pasted (npm init -y) this added the package .json to my folder
 then i pasted this ( npm install react react-dom) this added package lock.json
 then this(npm install --save-dev parcel) to add all the necessary addons
 then i created the index.html file in the main folder
as we are creating the things manually we have to manually create the git ignore src folder and app .js files and all if i would have created using jsx then it would have created by default
